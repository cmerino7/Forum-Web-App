            <p><strong>What is ACME Forums?</strong></p>
            <p>ACME Formus is an online forum dedicated to being a place for quizative minds from all over the world to gather and partake
                 in stimulating intellectual discussions!</p>
            <p>We hope our users come to make and find ACME Forums a place to respectfully share their voices with the world, to look for
                the voices of others, whether they are one's views on a topic, or even just seeking an answer as help and to learn from others.</p>
            <p>All kinds of topics are welcome on this forum as we wish to encourage diverse opinions and knowledge to be shared with the world.
                The internet, after all, is supposed to be the accumulation of all human knowledge.</p>
            <p>So what are you waiting for?  Put on your thinking cap and dive into the ocean of knowledge that is ACME Forums today!</p>

            <p><strong>The making of the intellectual ACME Forums!</strong></p>
            <p>Our wonderful team comprised of Chester Merino, Salvador Ruiz-Ramirez, Isaac Perez, and Francisco Gavidia Santana were the ones who brought 
                ACME Forums to life! Salvador "SalYourPal" Ruiz-Ramirez went into the trenches to produce a strong and reliable back-end for ACME forums to be
                 built upon.  Chester "camm12" Merino built up many of the wonderful pages you see here and will see as you navigate through the
                 forums.  Isaac "LiquidWolf88" Perez provided some glow up to our pages as well as the resource pages tied to this site.  As for
                 Francisco "Maksim8421" Gavida Santana... I'm... not quite sure if he is alive... Hmm... Oh, well.  Give our team much love, they worked hard to bring 
                ACME Forums to life!</p>
            <p></p>

            <p><strong>USER TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></p>
            <p>Here at ACME Forums, we only ask two general and simple rules of our users:</p>
            <p>BE RESPECTFUL</p>
            <p>As we encourage free thinking, we are aware that many of our users' views will clash with one another.  Disagreement 
                is the catalyst for deep and heated debates and discussions!  So it's perfectly normal and acceptable, MOST of us are only human, after all.
                We at ACME Forums simply ask that users keep their debates and disagreements civil.</p>
            <p>NO MALICOUS SPREADING OF MISINFORMATION</p>
            <p>Ignorance is the death of progress!  While it's perfectly fine to be incorrect on a factual issue, ACME Forums will not
                tolerate intentional attempts to mislead other users with misinformation, slander, or libel of any kind.  We seek to be
                humble intellects here on the forums as it is the core of our mission.  We take any attempt to undermine that mission very seriously.</p>
